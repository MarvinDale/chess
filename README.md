# Chess

This prototype will be a full stack chess webapp.
I'm planning on using JavaScript on the front end and Java on the backend. Once enough progress has been made I'll deploy the project using AWS

## Roadmap

- Create frontend client that displays the chessboard and sends moves to the backend
- Create backend that validates moves made on the front end and handles all game logic
- Deploy to AWS
